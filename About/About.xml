~= Work Tools for Pawns =~
     -REORGANIZED-

Original Mod Licence:
"Assets created by me, definitely, 100%, why would I lie here."

Major Changes
  • Removed some duplicate-functioning tools (spoons for example)
  • Removed backpacks and dufflebags (other mods handle these better, who carries a backpack in their hands anyway?)
  • Added stats to the descriptions of every tool
